In the use case diagram "System Actors", 4 roles can be seen. Those roles
are "Camera Unit", "Storage Unit", "Web Server", and "User's Web Browser."
These roles may be separated, such that each role exists on a separate
computer, or the roles may be combined on fewer computers, as
the user desires.

In the simplest case, a separate computer is assigned to each instance
of each role. For example, a system with 3 camera unit roles, 3 storage
unit roles, 1 web server role, and 1 web browser role would need
8 computers. This approach would incur the highest cost for a given number
of roles.

Several roles may be combined on a single computer to reduce cost without
sacrificing redundancy. For example, every camera unit may double as a storage
unit for other cameras, and the user's computer may double as the web server
that is used for reconfiguration and viewing. The above example with 8 roles
could be implemented with only 4 computers using this arrangement.

Many different arrangements may satisfy the needs of the user. The system
design should not limit the division of roles among different computers.
